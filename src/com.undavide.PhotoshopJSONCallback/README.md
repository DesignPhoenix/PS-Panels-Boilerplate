## Features
Switch on some switches, then close and reopen the panel - they reset.
Switch on the Persistent switch before, then play with the other ones; when you close and reopen the panel, the same configuration appears.

## Installation
Please see the shared [installation instruction](../../README.md#installation) (and don't forget the Debug flag!)
